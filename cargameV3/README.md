# CarGameV2
Car Game Project
Backup made for the game, current build being uploaded has no bugs 
Things still needed to be added are the scoring and sounds
Things needing adjusting is the movement and possibly gameplay window size and the timer display
Cosmetic changes could include the fonts for the informational outputs
Change of heart in background repetiveness - could go to a prerendered map once game is fully done
or find an algorithm to pull map pieces into scene from a dump of sorts
